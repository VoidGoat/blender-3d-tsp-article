# blender-3d-tsp-article
Solving the traveling salesperson problem in 3D. Created using Blender 3.1.0 and Python scripting.

## Getting Started
To use the script, open 3D-TSP-Art.blend and navigate to the scripting tab where the file `tsp-2opt.py` should be open. Select a mesh in the viewport and then run the script. A TSP path will then be generated for the mesh. You can also import the `tsp-2opt.py` file into any other blender project and use it there. 

Beware! Running on large meshes may take many minutes or hours. Keep the Blender system console open so you can keep track of the progress of the algorithm.
